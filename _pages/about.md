I'm currently a computational chemist working at Corteva Agriscience. I mainly provide cheminformatics support and AI/ML modeling to the in-silico platform construction and discovery projects. My research interests focus on early-stages in AI/ML drug discovery, including target identification, hit identification, hit-2-lead and lead optimization. 

I'm a command-line person. I love coding to solve chemistry problems. rdKit is my best friend for cheminformatics solution, while scikit-learn and pyTorch are my best buddies to build ML models.
