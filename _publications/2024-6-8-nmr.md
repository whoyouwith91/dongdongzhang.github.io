title: "Accurate Prediction of NMR Chemical Shifts: Integrating DFT Calculations with Three-Dimensional Graph Neural Networks"
collection: publications
abstract: "This study presents a new 3D GNN model to predict 1H and 13C chemical shifts, CSTShift, that combines atomic features with DFT-calculated shielding tensor descriptors, capturing both isotropic and anisotropic shielding effects. Utilizing the NMRShiftDB2 data set and conducting DFT optimization and GIAO calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, we prepared the NMRShiftDB2-DFT data set of high-quality 3D structures and shielding tensors with corresponding experimentally measured 1H and 13C chemical shifts. The developed CSTShift models achieve the state-of-the-art prediction performance on both the NMRShiftDB2-DFT test data set and external CHESHIRE data set. Further case studies on identifying correct structures from two groups of constitutional isomers show its capability for structure assignment and elucidation. "
