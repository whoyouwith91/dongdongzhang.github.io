title: "The study on the electron transfer between cytochrome c and single-walled carbon nanotube â€“ The calculations of the reorganization free energy, the coupling matrix element and the rate constant"
collection: publications
abstract: "We have studied the electron transfer (ET) reaction between the cytochrome c (Cyt c) and the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). The ET reorganization energy, the ET coupling matrix element and the ET rate constant for Cyt c-SWCNT system have been calculated using QM + MM and the pathway tunneling model based on semi-classical Marcus theory.
